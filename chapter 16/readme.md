Plugins

The Carrier plugin is a native plugin for Android and iOS which exposes some simple telephony APIs to a Cordova application. You can add this plugin to your projects directly from the  [Cordova Plugin Registry](http://plugins.cordova.io/#/package/com.johnwargo.carrier).

The MOL plugin is a JavaScript-only plugin that calculates the Meaning of Life (the ["Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29) from Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy - simplified by me to 'Meaning of Life').
