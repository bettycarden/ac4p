  <h1>Example 1.1</h1>
  <p>This is a sample Apache Cordova application. Notice how the application's UI is pretty boring. This is because I didn't do anything to make the UI special. Instead, this application consists of a very simple HTML page with no embellishments.</p>
  <p>The application UI is implemented using the default settings for the mobile device's webView.</p>
