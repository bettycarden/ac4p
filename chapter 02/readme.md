Apache Cordova 4 Programming: Chapter 2
========================================

This folder contains sample source code from Apache Cordova 4 Programming Chapter 2. This chapter covers the Anatomy of an Apache Cordova application. In this chapter, I start with a simple web application and show how to turn it into a Cordova application then I show more complex examples as I describe the structure of a Cordova application.

This folder contains the following projects:

+ ex2.1 - HelloWorld1, a simple web application with no Cordova features
+ ex2.2 - HelloWorld2, adds the Cordova deviceready event listener
+ ex2.3 - HelloWorld3, demonstrates what happens when you add an additional deviceready event listener in a Cordova application.
+ ex2.4 - HelloWorld4, demonstrates how to use the Cordova Device API
+ ex2.5 - HelloWorld5, a prettier version of the HelloWorld4 application
+ ex2.6 - HelloWorld6, demonstrates how to split a Cordova application's JavaScript code into a separate file
+ ex2.7 - Example 2.7, demonstrates how to implement responsive design in a Cordova application

The source code was written from an educational standpoint, no effort was made to make the code small or fast, just readable and easily understandable.
