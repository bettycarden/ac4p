Apache Cordova 4 Programming: Chapter 11
========================================

This folder includes a simple alert demo application that demonstrates how to implement an `alert()` function that works in Microsoft Windows Universal Apps.

The application is like all of my sample Cordova applications in that it uses a call to `alert()` in the `onBodyLoad()` function then uses the Cordova `alert()` in the `onDeviceReady()` function. The Cordova `alert()` uses the Dialogs plugin, so don't forget to add the plugin to your project before running it.
