Apache Cordova 4 Programming: Chapter 6
=======================================

The files in this folder are some helper files I created to align with the content in the chapter.

The cva-create files (.cmd and .sh) are the example code from Listing 6.1 and 6.2, essentially scripts that automate the Cordova application creation process.

The make-hooks files (.cmd and .sh) are simple script files that create the hooks sub-folders for you.

The pause.cmd file is a simple Windows command file I created to help me test Hooks on Windows. It does nothing except write some text to the terminal window then execute the pause command which causes the command file to wait until a keypress before existing.

The test.js file is a simple node application I created to help me test running a node application as a hook. The application simply writes some content to the console and nothing more.
