Apache Cordova 4 Programming: Chapter 14
========================================

This folder contains sample projects I used in the book to demonstrate many of the Cordova Core APIs. I didn't show full applications in this chapter, only pulled out the relevant code for each API. Also, I didn't include applications for all of the APIs; for example a complete Compass application is missing from this chapter, but covered in detail in Chapter 15.

The best place to find a complete set of sample applications for each of the Cordova APIs is in my [Apache Cordova API Cookbook](http://cordovacookbook.com/) and on the book's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/johnwargo/apache-cordova-api-cookbook-code).
